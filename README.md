# Banana Pi M2 Ultra
Here are my projects based on Banana Pi M2 Ultra, which is a great board [http://www.banana-pi.org/m2u.html](http://www.banana-pi.org/m2u.html).
I use it for VPN, screen, network attached storage, ...
Powerful enough to run Firefox (MATE Desktop Environment) on a vncserver, but I mainly use the board without a GUI.

## Linux server with Fedora 32

## Server electricity consumption
